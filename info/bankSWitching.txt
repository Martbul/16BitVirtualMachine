Overview

createBankedMemory creates a memory management system with multiple banks that the CPU can switch between, allowing more total memory than could fit in a single address space.

Allocates n separate memory banks
Each bank is a byte slice of size bankSize
These are the raw memory buffers that will hold data

Wraps each raw memory bank in a bytes.Buffer
This provides methods for reading and writing data
