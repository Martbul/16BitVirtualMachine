The cpu has registers/instruction pointer, stack pointer,frame pointer, accumulator and general/, they are used to track state.
The stack gives you a temporary state

Memory is represented by a slice of byte and a stack

The memory mapper is a layer between the cpu and the memory. It maps memory addresses to devices. THe base is 16 bit -> there are 0xffff unifuly addressable bytes, what are devided into a different devices(RAM, output, ...)
